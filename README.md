# characteristic_curves
This repository contains code for visualizing characteristic curves of partial differential equations.

Example 1: First Order Linear Partial Differential Equation

f(x, y, u, u_t, u_x) = a u_t + b u_x = 0

a) Graph of Characteristic Curve family

b) Animation of u(t,x) where 0<=t<=t*<=t_max

Example 2: Burger's Equation

Example 3: Wave Equation
